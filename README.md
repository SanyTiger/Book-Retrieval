# Book Retrival Tool
This Java tool attempts to search and retrieve book information from a dataset of 100k books, including title, author name, publishing house, ISBN-11, ISBN-13, date, checked out, availablility and date of last check out. The dataset, hosted on a traditional databse MySQL, contains very less overhead that allows for faster retieval of data. 
This code is also an enumeration of good design patterns allowing for future scaling and inclusion of additional functionalities.
